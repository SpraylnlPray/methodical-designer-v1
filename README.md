## Code Styles
The ideas are from https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js

### Styles
- Tab size is 2, only use tabs for indentation, no whitespaces
- Single quotes for any string value
- Whitespaces after opening and before closing parenthesis
- else/catch/finally/chained methods always on new line
- Opening braces on same line
- Comments go above the code that is being referenced
- No end of line comments!
- The only language used in the project is english
- Naming convention:
    ```javascript
        functionNamesLikeThis;
        variableNamesLikeThis;
        ConstructorNamesLikeThis;
        EnumNamesLikeThis;
        methodNamesLikeThis;
        SYMBOLIC_CONSTANTS_LIKE_THIS;
    ```
